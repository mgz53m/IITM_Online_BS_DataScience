# Data Analysis with Card Example

In this example, we'll be analyzing a set of cards representing students in a class. Each card contains a student's details including mathematics marks. We'll follow a systematic process to count the students and calculate the average mathematics score.

## Counting the Students
To begin with, we want to count the total number of students. We can use an iteration process, where we count each card one by one:

```python
# Initialize count to 0
count = 0

# Start iterating over the cards
for card in cards:
    # For each card, increment the count
    count += 1

print(f"The total number of students is {count}")
```

The value of `count` is updated (or changes) for each card, which is why it's called a variable. At the end of this process, `count` represents the total number of students.

## Calculating the Average Score
Now, let's calculate the average mathematics score. For this, we need to add up all the math marks and then divide by the number of students:

```python
# Initialize sum to 0
sum = 0

# Start iterating over the cards
for card in cards:
    # For each card, add the mathematics mark to the sum
    sum += card.math_mark

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
average = sum / count

print(f"The average math score is {average}")
```

Here, `sum` is another variable that accumulates the total mathematics marks. Once all cards are processed, it represents the total mathematics marks of all students. We then divide `sum` by `count` to get the average mathematics mark.

## Optimized Approach
While the above method works fine, it involves iterating over the cards twice. We can optimize this process by keeping track of both `count` and `sum` in a single iteration:

```python
# Initialize count and sum to 0
count = 0
sum = 0

# Start iterating over the cards
for card in cards:
    # For each card, increment the count and add the mathematics mark to the sum
    count += 1
    sum += card.math_mark

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
average = sum / count

print(f"The total number of students is {count}")
print(f"The average math score is {average}")
```

In this single iteration, we're updating two variables, `count` and `sum`, for each card. This approach yields the same result but with half the number of iterations.
