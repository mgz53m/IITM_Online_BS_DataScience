# Course Overview and Data Types

This course sets the framework for understanding computational thinking patterns and how to apply these to different types of data.

## Main Types of Data

We're going to discuss three main types of data:

### 1. School Report Cards

Each report card includes key information such as:

- Name of the student
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Place of birth
- Marks in subjects (maths, physics, and chemistry)

Each card is given a unique number to differentiate between students.

The primary purpose of these report cards is to illustrate how to calculate various quantities based on the data.

### 2. Shopping Bills

Typically, a shopping bill will contain:

- The date
- Name of the shop
- Items purchased, including quantity and price

For this course, a simplified form of the shopping bill will be used. This also includes:

- The name of the customer
- A serial number for identification

We can ask various questions about the bills to understand customer spending habits and shop performance.

### 3. Collection of Words from a Paragraph

In this data type, a paragraph, taken from the book "Swami and Friends" by R.K. Narayan, is broken down into individual words. Each word is represented on a card with the following information:

- The word itself
- A serial number
- The type of speech
- The number of letters in the word

This data type allows us to ask questions about the words, such as the count of different types of speech, and the length of words.

Overall, these data sets will be used to illustrate how to systematically compute quantities and apply these patterns to solve different problems.
